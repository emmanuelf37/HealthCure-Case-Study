# HealthCure-Case-Study

## Python Code and Tableau Presentation for Career Foundry

### For this Project, I was tasked to source my own data and create a case study around it to analyze in python and present in Tableau. I used data from the CDC on deaths data for COVID-19 and related illnesses to create a case study for a vaccine company. My role was to analyze the data in order to help them establish themselves by gaining a target market and to know where to establish themselves in order to meet the areas of greatest need.
